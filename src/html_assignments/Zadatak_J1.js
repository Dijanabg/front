Tokyo, officially the Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital and most populous prefecture of Japan. Located
at the head of Tokyo Bay, the prefecture forms part of the Kantō region on the central Pacific coast
of Japan's main island of Honshu. Tokyo is the political and economic center of the country, as well
as the seat of the Emperor of Japan and the national government. As of 2021, the prefecture has an
estimated population of 13,960,236. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan
area in the world, with more than 37.393 million residents as of 2020.
Originally a fishing village, named Edo, the city became a prominent political center in 1603, when it
became the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo was one of the most
populous cities in the world at over one million. Following the end of the shogunate in 1868, the
imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to the city, which was renamed Tokyo (literally "eastern
capital"). Tokyo was devastated by the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, and again by Allied bombing
raids during World War II. Beginning in the 1950s, the city underwent rapid reconstruction and
expansion, going on to lead Japan's post-war economic recovery. Since 1943, the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's 23 special wards (formerly Tokyo City),
various bed towns in the western area, and two outlying island chains.
